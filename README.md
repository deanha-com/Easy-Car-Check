# Easy Car Check v.3.0

A responsive web app made for mobile devices.

This is an additional version from my original idea of the [Car Check v1](https://github.com/deanha-com/CarCheck-v1) and [Vehichle Car Buy v2](https://github.com/deanha-com/VehicleCheckBuy-WebApp-v2).

A simple app that uses iframe to load the websites that allows you to do vehicle and MOT history checks.

Its extreamely useful if you are looking to buy a used car.

####Features
* basic car info
* car MOT status
* car TAX status
* MOT History

#### Pending features
* pre-purchase tips page - guiding you on what you should check for before going ahead with your purchase.

* bargaining tips - info on how you can get the price down, even just a little bit.

This web-app was build upon the TabStylesInspiration which is available
[here](http://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=19559).

The reason I have chosen to use this is because it has a very mobile app feel to it. The off-canvas navigation works very well.
